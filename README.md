# precision-aquaculture
This repository contains code related:
1. an online course for Precision Aquaculture that posits the value of [Julia](https://julialang.org/) as a programming language for applied data science such as is demanded in aquaculture. It provides
 - an introduction to Julia programming langugage
 - an overview of data wrangling in Julia and
 - data science applications in Juliana
 2. Code for data driven interrogation of aquaculture dataset. It details the interrogation of environmental and hydroacoustic datasets from an actual salmon farm. Details are provide in our paper [`Data Driven Insight into Fish Behaviour and their use for Precision Aquaculture`](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fanim.2021.695054/abstract)
